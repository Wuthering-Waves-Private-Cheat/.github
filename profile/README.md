## 🌙 Feature Spotlight: Resonance Aim Whisper

Wuthering Waves is full of fast-moving threats—lunging constructs, teleporting aberrants, aerial specters.
This private module adds **feather-light alignment cues**, barely perceptible yet profoundly helpful.

No snapping.
No artificial drag.
Just a quiet presence helping your reticle flow with the music of combat.

## 💬 FAQ

### Does this change drop rates, stats, or Echo RNG?

No. All modifications remain purely client-side.

### Will other players see my overlays?

Never—everything is local and isolated.

### How heavy is the performance impact?

Visual layers add ~2–4% GPU load. Mobility/aim modules are nearly cost-free.

### Can I disable combat aids and keep only Echo tracking?

Yes—every module is independent.

### Are private profiles supported?

Absolutely—store unlimited JSON/INI sets with encrypted headers.

### Controller compatibility?

Fully supported; drift/aim systems auto-adapt to analog curves.

## Final Thoughts

Wuthering Waves is a song of wind and ruin—
a living poem where battles bloom like storms and traversal is a dance of memory and motion.

This **Private Cheat Suite** does not overwrite that poetry—
it clarifies it, sharpens it, and lets your instincts take center stage.

May your echoes shine,
your movements glide like currents of air,
and your battles resound across the trembling skyline.
